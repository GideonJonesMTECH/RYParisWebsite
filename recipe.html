      "No more dry, lackluster burgers. These are juicy, and spices can easily
      be added or changed to suit anyone's taste. Baste frequently with your
      favorite barbeque sauce. If you find the meat mixture too mushy, just add
      more bread crumbs until it forms patties that hold their shape."

  <h2>Directions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Place a roasting rack on a foil-lined
      baking sheet in the oven.
    </li>
    <li>
      Using your hands, break the meat into small pieces and combine evenly but
      loosely on a parchment or waxed paper-lined baking sheet. Spread the meat
      out and season it generously with salt and pepper. If desired, add the
      spice mix at this time.
    </li>
    <li>
      Divide the meat into 4 portions (about 6 ounces each). Using your hands,
      form each portion into a ball-shape by gently tossing it from one hand to
      the other. (Don't overwork or press too firmly on the meat.) Gently form
      each portion into a patty about 3 1/2 inches wide and 1 inch thick.
    </li>
    <li>
      Preheat a large cast iron skillet over medium-low heat for 5 minutes.
      Raise the heat to high and add the oil. Add the patties and cook, turning
      once, until well-browned, about 2 minutes on each side.
    </li>
    <li>
      Using a spatula, transfer the hamburgers to the roasting rack in the oven
      and continue cooking to desired doneness, 8 to 9 minutes for medium-rare,
      10 to 11 minutes for medium, and 13 to 15 minutes for well-done. If you
      are using cheese, top the hamburgers during their last couple of minutes
      of cooking to melt.
    </li>
    <li>
      Transfer the hamburgers to a plate, let rest for a couple minutes before
      serving. Meanwhile, toast the hamburger buns. Assemble the hamburgers with
      the condiments and toppings of your choice. Serve.
    </li>
    <li>
      When cooking on a countertop grill, turn on grill, then place burgers on
      the heated grill.
    </li>
    <strong>Timing for a countertop grill:</strong>
    <li>
      For Medium-Rare: Cook for 3 minutes covered and then unplug the machine
      and continue to cook covered for 2 to 3 more minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      For Medium: Cook for 4 minutes covered, and then unplug the machine and
      continue to cook covered for 4 more minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      For Well: Cook for 5 minutes covered and then unplug the machine. Continue
      cooking for 5 minutes covered.
    </li>
  </ol>
