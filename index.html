  <h2>Where to Eat</h2>
  <p>
    This is not the aspirational fluff of Intagram wall neon; it's fact. Recent
    surveys have shown that a majority of travelers consider food when planning
    a trip, even ahead of where they sleep. Add to this that people are also
    traveling more than ever before - earthlings logged a record-breaking 1.4
    billion international trips last year - and it's safe to say the the hunger
    for new culinary experiences is more ravenous than ever.

    While the endlessly alluring bistros of Paris, izakayas of Tokyo, shwarma
    stands of Tel Aviv, and tasting menus of Mexico City will always top
    people's lists of cravings, we're continually on the lookout for something
    new to fill our bellies, our passports, and our feeds.
